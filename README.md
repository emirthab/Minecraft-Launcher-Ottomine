## What Is Ottomine

Ottomine roleplay mode is an audio role-playing game mode that takes the Ottoman era style in a utopian way. It does not fully reflect reality, historically and geographically. Only the basics in history have been treated as an Ottomine roleplay mode.

- It adds minecraft mods as a library and launches minecraft.
